# MUG-react-native
Monash Unit Guide built in React Native

 This application is a tool rebuilt in React-Native aimed at making a deeper indepth
experience using various newer packages then what I did earlier this year, this project
aims at making the https://github.com/units-at-monash repo great again.

## Directory Structure

The repo is designed to be a awesome highly-maintainable structure
